# NLP Feature Extraction Techniques

## Overview
This repository hosts a Jupyter notebook dedicated to exploring various feature extraction techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The notebook serves as a comprehensive guide, demonstrating different methods to extract meaningful features from text data, a critical step in many NLP applications such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and text classification.

## Contents
The notebook includes detailed explanations and implementations of the following topics:
1. **Text Preprocessing**: Covers essential text cleaning and normalization techniques including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and removal of stopwords.
2. **Traditional Feature Extraction Methods**: Explores Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and N-grams with practical examples and their application in text analysis.
3. **Word Embeddings**: Detailed walkthrough on Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText embeddings, including their implementation using popular Python libraries.
4. **Embeddings Comparison**: A comparative analysis highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of different embedding models in various NLP tasks.
5. **Contextualized Word Representations**: An introduction to advanced embedding techniques that incorporate context for a deeper understanding of word meanings.
